<!--Componentes-->
componentes.body-Mt=Materials
componentes.body-Ar=Arduino 
componentes.body-Tx1=The Arduino is a board based on an ATMEL microcontroller. Microcontrollers are integrated circuits in which instructions can be recorded, which you write with the programming language that you can use in the Arduino IDE environment. These instructions allow you to create programs that interact with the circuitry on the board.
componentes.body-Tm=Temperature sensor
componentes.body-Ag=The DS18B20 is a digital temperature sensor that uses the 1-Wire protocol to communicate, this protocol needs only one data pin to communicate and allows more than one sensor to be connected on the same bus. The DS18B20 sensor is manufactured by Maxim Integrated, the factory package is type TO-92 similar to that used in small transistors. The most used commercial presentation for convenience and robustness is that of the sensor inside a waterproof stainless steel tube, with which we will work this tutorial.
componentes.body-Md=Wi-Fi Module
componentes.body-Wf=The ESP8266 is a highly integrated chip designed for the needs of a new connected world. It offers a complete and self-contained Wi-Fi networking solution, allowing you to host the application or serve as a bridge between the Internet and a microcontroller.
componentes.body-Vn=8V fan
componentes.body-Txv=This small but powerful fan measures 50x50x10mm and operates at 5V. It is very common in computers and also serves to ventilate all kinds of projects that are prone to getting too hot and we want them to stay cool. Its consumption is around 200mA.
componentes.body-Ptb=Protoboard
componentes.body-Txpb=Breadboard or breadboard is a rectangular plastic board with lots of little holes in it. These holes allow you to easily insert electronic components to prototype (that is, build and test an early version of) an electronic circuit, such as with a battery, a switch, a resistor, and an LED (light-emitting diode). It is a simple tool used to easily connect electrical components and cables to each other. Only certain types of components and cables are applicable for breadboard use. As long as the components have through-hole pins (as opposed to surface mount), they are probably applicable for breadboards.
componentes.body-Cb=Set of Cables
componentes.body-Txcb=A prototype jumper cable (or simply prototype bridge), is a cable with a connector on each end (or sometimes without them), which is normally used to interconnect components on a breadboard. P.E .: They are generally used to transfer electrical signals from anywhere on the prototype board to the input / output pins of a microcontroller.
componentes.body-Tr=Transistor PN2222
componentes.body-Txtr=The 2N2222, too identified as PN2222, it is a low-voltage NPN bipolar transistor general purpose power. It serves both for applications of amplification and switching. Can amplify small currents at small or medium voltages; therefore it can only treat low powers (not greater than half a watt). You can work at medium high frequencies.
componentes.body-Rs=Resistance
componentes.body-Txrs=The resistors are one of the basic types of electronic components. Have two terminals and a semiconductor, it is made up of carbon and other resistive elements. A semiconductor is just what it sounds like: something that conducts electricity, but not that well. While conductors like copper and gold are used in circuits to allow the flow of electricity freely, a semiconductor is used to provide a certain resistance to the flow of electricity. That is why a resistance has this name. When electricity passes through the semiconductors, some of it turns into heat. The greater the voltage, the greater the energy.



<!--Instructivo-->
instructivo.body-Cm=How to use
instructivo.body-Txcm=Implement a web application so that it allows us to work and establish a connection with the Arduino IDE in an efficient and effective way in handling information from the temperature records that will be obtained thanks to the LM35 sensor to monitor the temperature, as well as the date. and the time that the fan that will be in the circuit was running when a mobile device reaches temperatures higher than 24 ° C, the web application will store the temperature detected as some characteristics of the mobile device which will be: its battery, processor and time of use on screen on in which high temperatures were detected in the mobile, this information is to be consulted later to know why the device overheats.
instructivo.body-In=Login
instructivo.body-Txin=This use case allows users to validate their identity before the system, a dialog box is displayed on the screen where enter the user login and password to enter the application.
instructivo.body-Pg=Main Page
instructivo.body-Txpg=After logging in, we will be shown the main page that will contain 4 elements which will be components, How to Use Test Test and Contact Us
instructivo.body-Cmp=Components
instructivo.body-Txcmp=This page contains all the materials that we use to make the test, such as the Arduino 1 or an ESP32
instructivo.body-Rd=Register Device
instructivo.body-Txrd=A form is displayed on the screen where the phone data to enter, so that it can access the information
instructivo.body-Cnt=Contact us
instructivo.body-Txcnt=This page will help us if any of our users have problem with our application or have doubts about him through a form has to be filled out and by means of an email you we will give you notice
